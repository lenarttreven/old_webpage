		<p>Since Autumn 2018 I am attending a Data Science Master Program at ETH Zürich. Before that I was studying Mathematics at University of Ljubljana. Currenlty I am working on my Master Thesis in the field of Adpative Control in Reinforcement Learning. I have an interst in algorithms, distributed systems and in online reinforcement learning.</p>

		<p>Besides my studies I also worked on a couple of projects. Lately I was Optimizing the production of some Chemicals for a Swiss pharmaceutical company Eumedica. In the summer 2018 I did an internship as software developer in Xlab d.o.o. and in summer 2017 I was an intern at the Department of Solid State Physics at the Institute 'Jozef Stefan'.</p>
